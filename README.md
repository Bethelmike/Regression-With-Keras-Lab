# Regression with Keras
Welcome to the Regression with Keras project! This repository is designed to guide you through the process of implementing regression tasks using the Keras deep learning library. Regression is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict continuous numerical values. This project will help you understand how to set up a regression model using Keras for various applications.

# Introduction
Regression is a fundamental concept in machine learning, and Keras simplifies the process of building and training regression models. This project focuses on demonstrating how to create a regression model using Keras, starting from setting up the data to training and evaluating the model's performance.
